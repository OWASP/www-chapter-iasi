We're kicking off OWASP Iași local chapter with a presentation on The Anatomy of a supply chain attack, where we'll have as guest Dragoș Gavriluț, Director at BitDefender, coordinating the Cyber Threat Intelligence Lab.

A supply chain attack is any cyberattack that seeks to tamper with the production process of a third-party software package in such a way that the delivered package is malicious. Attackers first compromise the supplier using common techniques like targeted phishing emails, malicious websites, guessing weak passwords, abusing Remote Desktop Protocol, etc. Then they move to find the production server (GitHub, Apache Subversion, etc.) where versioning development occurs on the company’s product. Here, the attackers change the software build currently in production, lacing it with malicious code, taking care to hide their tracks. When development is finished and the update is ready for shipping, the company unknowingly signs it with a valid certificate and sends it off to its customers. The customers are inadvertently infected when they deploy the new software, not knowing it’s been tainted.
